# Mathematical-Modelling-for-Neuroscience

 The aim of our project is to investigate the activity of neurons in the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli. 
 We employ experimental data from the Allen Institute, which collect measurements of neural activity across different layers and areas of the visual cortex and thalamus of mice when subject to visual stimuli.
 In our project we consider a specific type of visual stimuli which were shown to a subject. The stimuli we consider are static gratings, which have three varying 
 parameters (orientation, spatial frequency, and phase). 
 We are interested in understanding how different combinations of parameters affect the neuronal response and how responses differ between distinct areas of the visual cortex.
